# This project reveals insights about TV and Movie content hosted on Netflix. 

# The project was written using the PostgreSQL dialect and utilized data from the following two Netflix datasets:

--Figuring out what these two tables have in common.

SELECT * FROM "netflix_titles_info" LIMIT 3;
SELECT * FROM "netflix_people" LIMIT 3;

SELECT netflix_titles_info.type, netflix_titles_info.title, netflix_titles_info.release_year, netflix_people.director, netflix_people.cast
FROM "netflix_titles_info"

INNER JOIN "netflix_people"
ON netflix_titles_info.show_id=netflix_people.show_id;

--How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT(type)
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

SELECT title
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

--When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database

SELECT type
, title
, date_added
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY date_added desc;

select max(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

--List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT type 
, title
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

--Who was the Director for the movie The Starling?

SELECT netflix_people.director
,netflix_titles_info.title
FROM "netflix_people"
LEFT JOIN "netflix_titles_info"
ON netflix_titles_info.show_id=netflix_people.show_id
WHERE netflix_titles_info.title='The Starling';

--What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT type
, title
, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc;

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <=
(SELECT MIN(release_year)
