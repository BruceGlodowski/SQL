In this query I used this to figure out colums in the table 

SELECT *
FROM superstore;

For this query used this to limit the rows to 5

SELECT *
FROM superstore
LIMIT 5;

This query I just wanted the item name and price to be displayed in decending order

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

Wanted the total cost of all products from the table "superstore"

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

Wanted the average cost of all products from the table "superstore"

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore;

Wanted to figure out the lowest cost item from the table "superstore"

SELECT MIN(price)
FROM superstore;

Wanted to know the highest priced item from the table "superstore"

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore;

Wanted to find the name and stock quantity COUNT but it wasnsn't working so this is how I found out the item name and stock 
quantity in decending order

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
ORDER BY stock_quantity DESC;

In this query I wanted the name and price from only category labeled, "Kitchen Supplies"

SELECT item_name, category, price
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"
ORDER BY price DESC;
